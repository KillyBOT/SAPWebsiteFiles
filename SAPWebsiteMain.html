      Hello! My name is Kyle.
      I am an eighth grade student at The School At Columbia.
      This website was made as a social action project against the War on Science.
      For the uninitiated, the War on Science is the battle between Scientists and
      people defunding and inhibiting scientific research. Many scientists have been
      forced to churn out scientific reports that have catchy names rather than research
      that could benefit our society. For instance, according to this pie chart on the <a href="https://www.nationalpriorities.org/">National
      Priorities Project</a>, less than one percent of national spending goes to science.
