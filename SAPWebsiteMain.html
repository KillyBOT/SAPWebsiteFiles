      Hello! My name is Kyle.
      I am an eighth grade student at The School At Columbia.
      This website was made as a social action project against the War on Science.
      For the uninitiated, the War on Science is the battle between Scientists and
      people defunding and inhibiting scientific research. Many scientists have been
      forced to churn out scientific reports that have catchy names rather than research
      that could benefit our society. For instance, according to this pie chart on the <a href="https://www.nationalpriorities.org/">National
      Priorities Project</a>, less than one percent of national spending goes to science.

        This is a major problem! Science is something that is needed throughout the world, and limiting
        scientific growth is the equivalent to tying a hand behind your back. Science is how we move forward,
        how we cure cancer, and how we save the world!
      </p>

        This webiste aims to spread scientific understanding and give science the appreciation
        it needs. On this website, you will find a plethora of cool science things including stories
        from scientists, books you can read, online science stories and other interesting things. Hopefully, this
        will help at least a little by spreading the love of science and, in turn, helping save it.
